yarn
yarn run build
```

This will create the built files in `dist/`.

To serve the website locally you can execute:

## Sources

Unicode Unicorn uses the Unicode Character Database. It can be
downloaded from <https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/>.
Download `UCD.zip` and extract its contents to `data/Unicode/UCD/`.
Then extract `Unihan.zip` and move the `Unihan` folder contents into
`data/Unicode/Unihan/`.

Codepage mapping files are from
<https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/>. Move the appropriate text
files into `data/Unicode/Mappings/`, and check the references in
`data/encodings.txt`.

Download `language-subtag-registry` from IANA
(<https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry>)
and place it into `data/`.

Download the ideographic variation database from
<https://unicode.org/ivd/> and place `IVD_Collections.txt` and
